A) Why was Python created in the first place?
http://effbot.org/pyfaq/why-was-python-created-in-the-first-place.htm

- Python language was created by Guido van Rossum during 1985- 1990.
- ABC group at CWI is the origin of many Python features.
- Modula-3 is the origin of the syntax and semantics used for exceptions, and some other Python features.
- Rossum had some complaints for ABC programming language and also it was not extensible(major issue).
- Due to this, python (extensible, interpreted, interactive, object-oriented, and high-level programming language) came into existence in 1989.

1) Python is interpreted: Code not needed to compile before executing.
2) Python is Interactive: Enter to Python prompt and write programs and interact with interpreter.
3) Python is Object-Oriented: supports OOPS(encapsulating code within objects).
4) Python is a Beginner's Language: Easy for new learners.

B) Python features: (http://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_overview.htm)
1) Easy to learn, read and maintain.
2) A broad standard library  - portable and platform compatible.
3) Interactive mode
4) Portable - run on variety of hardware platforms and same UI on all
5) Extendable
6) Databases - provides interfaces to DB
7) GUI Programming - supports GUI applications.
8) Scalable - better structure and support for large programs
