- Python language was created by Guido van Rossum during 1985- 1990.
- ABC group at CWI is the origin of many Python features.
- Modula-3 is the origin of the syntax and semantics used for exceptions, and some other Python features.
- Rossum had some complaints for ABC programming language and also it was not extensible(major issue).
- Due to this, python (extensible, interpreted, interactive, object-oriented, and high-level programming language) came into existence in 1989.
