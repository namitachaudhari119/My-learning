# Why was Python created in the first place?
http://effbot.org/pyfaq/why-was-python-created-in-the-first-place.htm

- Python language was created by Guido van Rossum during 1985- 1990.
- ABC group at CWI is the origin of many Python features.
- Modula-3 is the origin of the syntax and semantics used for exceptions, and some other Python features.
- Rossum had some complaints for ABC programming language and also it was not extensible(major issue).
- Due to this, python (extensible, interpreted, interactive, object-oriented, and high-level programming language) came into existence in 1989.

1) Python is interpreted: Code not needed to compile before executing.
2) Python is Interactive: Enter to Python prompt and write programs and interact with interpreter.
3) Python is Object-Oriented: supports OOPS(encapsulating code within objects).
4) Python is a Beginner's Language: Easy for new learners.

# Python features: (http://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_overview.htm)
1) Easy to learn, read and maintain.
2) A broad standard library  - portable and platform compatible.
3) Interactive mode
4) Portable - run on variety of hardware platforms and same UI on all
5) Extendable
6) Databases - provides interfaces to DB
7) GUI Programming - supports GUI applications.
8) Scalable - better structure and support for large programs

# Python Exception Handling:
1) Exception Handling : An exception is an event, which occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions. Python object that represents error.

A)
try:
   You do your operations here;
   ......................
except ExceptionI:
   If there is ExceptionI, then execute this block.
except ExceptionII:
   If there is ExceptionII, then execute this block.
   ......................
else:
   If there is no exception then execute this block. 

B) The except Clause with No Exceptions:
try:
   You do your operations here;
   ......................
except: (Catches all types of exceptions)
   If there is any exception, then execute this block.
   ......................
else:
   If there is no exception then execute this block. 
   
C) The except Clause with Multiple Exceptions:   
try:
   You do your operations here;
   ......................
except(Exception1[, Exception2[,...ExceptionN]]]):
   If there is any exception from the given exception list, 
   then execute this block.
   ......................
else:
   If there is no exception then execute this block.
   
D) The try-finally Clause:
try:
   You do your operations here;
   ......................
   Due to any exception, this may be skipped.
finally:
   This would always be executed.
   ......................

*Can provide except clause(s), or a finally clause, but not both. You cannot use else clause as well along with a finally clause.
   
2) Assertions : An assertion is a sanity-check that you can turn on or turn off when you are done with your testing of the program.
