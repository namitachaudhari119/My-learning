****************Multithreading*************
- Multiple threads within a process share the same data space with the main thread and so they can share information or communicate with each other more easily
- Called light-weight processes and do not require much memory overhead
- A thread has a beginning, an execution sequence, and a conclusion
  > It can be interrupted
  > It can temporarily be put on hold (sleep) while other threads are running - yielding

# Starting a new thread:
- thread.start_new_thread ( function, args[, kwargs] )
- The thread calls the function with passes args and when func returns the thread exits

# The Threading Module:(introduced in python 2.4)
- The threading module has the 'Thread' class that implements threading
- Methods provided by Thread class:
  > run() - entry point for thread
  > start() - starts a thread by calling the run()
  > join([time]) - waits for threads to terminate
  > isAlive() - checks thread is alive
  > getName() - returns name of thread
  > setName() - sets name of thread
