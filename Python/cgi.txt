******************Common Gateway Interface(CGI) Programmaing***********************
# What is CGI?
- CGI is set of standards which defines how info is exchanged between web server such as HTTP servers and custom script
- Currently CGI/1.1 is used
- Whenever a file in certain dir is requested, instead of returning that file a program can be executed and it's response can be displayed on the browser.
- CGI progs executed by HTTP server are kept in pre-defined dir /var/www/cgi-bin
- Files have extension as .cgi but .py is also allowed
- Content-type:text/html\r\n\r\n in the code is sent back to the browser and it specifies the content type to be displayed on the browser

# Passing Information using GET method:
- eg: http://www.test.com/cgi-bin/hello.py?key1=value1&key2=value2
- GET default method to pass info from browser to web server
- Has size limitation 1024 characters only
- Sends info using QUERY_STRING header and it will be accessible in cgi program using same header

# Passing Information Using POST Method:
- info is sent as separate message

# Using cookies in CGI:
- HTTP protocol is stateless
- Cookies are a plain text data record of 5 variable-length fields:
 > Expires(Optional): date when cookie will expire. If blank, cookie will expire when browser quits
 > Domain(Optional): domain name of site
 > Path(Optional): path to webpage that sets the cookie
 > Secure: If the field contains the word "secure" then the cookie can be retrieved only through secure server
 > Name=Value: Cookies set and retrieved in key-value pair
 
# Setting up Cookies:
- Cookies are sent along with HTTP header before Content-Type
- Set-Cookie HTTP header is used to set cookie

# Retrieving cookies:
- Cookies are stored in HTTP_COOKIE variable
